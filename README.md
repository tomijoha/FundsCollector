# FundsCollector

Equity funds collector from OP. Calculates floating averages for different funds and stores to SQL DB. Application has a timer 
based collection where the whatsdog checks the status between the OP funds webpage and the DB. I have used Re:dash https://github.com/getredash/redash
to visualize the data.
